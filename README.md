## Objective

Second Javascript exercise. ðŸ™Œ

Starting from the data provided by the teacher, the main idea of this exercise is to create JavaScript functions, which must comply with a series of rules for their realization: 
- Documented code
- Apply functional programming (separated into functions).
- The declaration of functions and variables must be in ENGLISH.
- Apply camel case scripting.
- Elaborate a README file explaining what has been done and including the instructions to execute the project.

#### Functions approach.

##### Data
```JavaScript
const exampleArray = [10, 4, 100, 35, 31, 23, 443, 221, 342, 10, 12, 42];
const shit = ["function", null, function () { }, () => { }, 10, 100, {}];
const exampleArray2 = [
    [10, 4, "100", 35, "31", "23", 443, "221", "342", 10, 12, 42]
]
function Point(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}
```

Proposed exercises.
1.- Create a function that finds the value 4 in the array exampleArray.
You must create an algorithm using functional programming
You must create another algorithm using imperative programming (filter, split, reduce or any of them that manipulate arrays).

2.- Create a function that cleans the shit array using declarative programming (split, join or any of them). The function must only leave the strings as result.

3.- Create a function that calculates the distance between two points using the object that I provide you as Point, you must use imperative programming for this exercise. Your function must receive two parameters, point a and point b and calculate the distance.

4.- Create a function that compares the values of exampleArray2 and exampleArray1 but that looks at the type.

## Application

1. Run the project using: `node index.js`.
2. And check the applied functions.

## Technologies

- Javascript
